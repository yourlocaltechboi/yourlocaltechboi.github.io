<h1><u>ABOUT ME</u></h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Anden Wieseler, and I like to make things.</p>
<p>I make websites and software, and I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm currently also learning Swift.</p>
<p>I spend my free time outside of work coding, designing, taking photos, playing Minecraft, and listening to my endlessly long Apple Music playlists (my longest is over 700 songs xD).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Currently, I'm working on the following projects:</b></p>
<p><b>Jailbreak Walkthrough - </b>This is a web-based walkthrough for jailbreaking iPhones and iPads!</p>
<p><b>Toggle - </b>Toggle is a modern Discord bot framework built using discord.js, and supports the creation of bots using both code and third-party modules!</p>
<p><b>Freelance Graphic/Web Design - </b>I love to work on web and graphic design projects in my free time!</p>
<br>
